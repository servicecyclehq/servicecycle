# Overnight session summary — 2026-06-18

Autonomous session against the ServiceCycle repo only. All work committed and
pushed to `origin/main`; deploys via the vps-control MCP loop (push → `git_pull` →
`docker compose up -d --build` → health curl). `tsc` + integration suite + client
`vite build` kept green throughout (final suite **258/258**).

## Shipped (commits on main, oldest → newest)

1. **`89f4b9c` — Help Center rewritten for ServiceCycle.** The whole Help Center
   was still LapseIQ content except `compliance-scoring`. Wrote/registered **12
   docs** grounded in the actual code — the 5 that were missing (assets, sites,
   contractors, schedules, work-orders) plus 7 that were rewritten from LapseIQ
   material (onboarding, dashboard, imports, alerts, reports, settings,
   api-and-integrations). Removed 5 LapseIQ orphans (budget, contracts,
   renewal-workflow, vendors, ingest); folded report/PDF ingest into the `imports`
   doc rather than registering `ingest`. Reordered `MODULE_INDEX` to mirror the
   left sidebar exactly (onboarding first; feature modules in sidebar order;
   compliance-scoring + api-and-integrations grouped as reference at the end).
   `loadAll()` now **13 loaded / 0 missing**. **Deployed + verified** (`/api/help/
   modules/assets` serves real content).

2. **`24975a0` — Security hardening** (`docs/SECURITY_REVIEW_2026-06-18.md`).
   Fixed: (a) backfill **zip decompression bomb** — reject on declared
   uncompressed size + a 400 MB per-batch inflate budget before materializing
   entries; (b) the **inbound email webhook had no rate limit** in front of its
   15 MB parse + HMAC — added 120/min/IP; (c) **capped inbound attachments** to 25
   per message / 15 MB each. Zip-slip, the public `/api/help` + parse endpoints,
   and signature verification were reviewed and found sound. **Deployed.**

3. **`59b5b0e` — #34 bulk backfill client UI.** New `/backfill` page (manager+ /
   oem_admin): optional site picker, zip upload, then polls the batch status every
   2.5 s with a progress bar, per-file status + cards-created counts, and
   truncated/skipped warnings. Wired into the Add-data hub (new card + `.zip`
   sniff). **Deployed + verified** (client container serving the new bundle).

4. **`3accc42` — Dependency audit + email-in tests**
   (`docs/DEPENDENCY_AUDIT_2026-06-18.md`). `npm audit fix` (non-breaking only)
   cleared form-data CRLF + @babel/core file-read across server & client (server
   prod advisories 4→1, client 4→2). Added `__tests__/routes/inboundEmail.test.ts`
   (7 tests) for the previously-untested #6 webhook (auth, routing, auto-commit
   fan-out, ack + no-reply suppression) and fixed the shared email mock to export
   `reportReceivedHtml`. **Server deploying** (lockfile → fresh `npm ci`).

5. **`63d1ed6` — a11y / fix.** `HelpDrawer` context-map pointed `/calendar` at a
   non-existent `calendar` module (404'd context-Help) — remapped to `schedules`
   and added the data-in routes → `imports`. Added a `role=status aria-live` live
   region to the backfill progress. **Pending client deploy** (batched).

6. **`523b6e6` — Code review writeup** (`docs/CODE_REVIEW_2026-06-18.md`),
   prioritized; trivially-safe items were fixed inline this session.

## Flagged for you (decisions, not acted on)

- **Auto-commit blast radius (P2).** Both email-in and #34 backfill write asset
  cards with no human review or undo. Sound auth, but junk-in = junk cards to
  clean up. Worth a "review/undo this batch" affordance or a confidence floor that
  parks low-confidence parses. (In both the security and code-review docs.)
- **Breaking dependency bumps (P2).** `js-yaml` 3→4 (server; exposure negligible —
  only parses our own OpenAPI spec, call site already 4.x-safe) and `vite` 6→8
  (client; the esbuild advisory is dev-server-only, not the shipped static build).
  Both safe to defer; schedule when convenient.
- **Broader a11y audit (P3).** I tightened the surfaces I touched (Help drawer,
  backfill UI). A fuller keyboard/contrast pass over Settings and the digest
  screens is worth a focused, reviewable session rather than unattended churn.
- **Inbound attachment download size guard (P3)** and the **OEM backfill job
  ownership split (P3)** — see the code-review doc.

## Not attempted (per your guardrails)
Email aliases (DNS/mailbox), founder-gated standards items, founder-gated roadmap
items, re-enabling the droplet AI board, major version upgrades, and ForgeRift's
`vps-control-mcp` L3 parser bug (item 7 — needs your explicit OK). Roadmap #19
offline-PWA stretch was skipped (not headlessly verifiable).

## Deploy state at session end
- **Server:** Help Center + security hardening live and verified; the dependency
  lockfile rebuild was the last server deploy.
- **Client:** backfill UI live; the a11y fix + patched client lockfile go out on
  the final client container rebuild.
